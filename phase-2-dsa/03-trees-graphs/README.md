## Study Tips

### For Trees:
1. **Master Recursion**: Most tree problems have elegant recursive solutions
2. **Understand Traversals**: Practice all three main traversal orders
3. **Think in Subtrees**: Break problems into left and right subtree operations
4. **Base Cases**: Always consider empty trees and single nodes

### For Graphs:
1. **Choose Right Representation**: Adjacency list vs matrix based on problem
2. **Master DFS/BFS**: These are building blocks for most graph algorithms
3. **State Management**: Track visited nodes to avoid infinite loops
4. **Problem Patterns**: Recognize when to use specific algorithms (Dijkstra, Union-Find, etc.)

## Implementation Complexity

### Trees:
- **Search**: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case for BST
- **Insertion/Deletion**: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case for BST
- **Traversals**: O(n) time, O(h) space where h is height

### Graphs:
- **DFS/BFS**: O(V + E) time, O(V) space
- **Dijkstra**: O((V + E) log V) with priority queue
- **Union-Find**: O(V * α(V)) where α is inverse Ackermann function
