## üîç Key Patterns and Techniques

### 1. Dummy Node Pattern
```cpp
ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
dummy->next = head;
// Simplifies edge cases where head might change
```
**When to use**: Problems involving head modifications, merging, or complex manipulations

### 2. Two Pointer Technique
```cpp
ListNode* slow = head;
ListNode* fast = head;
while (fast && fast->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
}
```
**Applications**: Finding middle, cycle detection, palindrome checking

### 3. Iterative Reversal
```cpp
ListNode* prev = nullptr;
ListNode* current = head;
while (current) {
    ListNode* next = current->next;
    current->next = prev;
    prev = current;
    current = next;
}
```
**Benefits**: O(1) space complexity, easier to understand than recursion

### 4. In-place Manipulation
- Modify existing nodes rather than creating new ones
- Careful pointer management to avoid memory leaks
- Essential for space-efficient solutions

### 5. Edge Case Handling
- Empty list (head == nullptr)
- Single node list
- Operations at boundaries (head/tail)
- Cycle handling in traversal

## üí° Pro Tips

### Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Draw the problem**: Visualize with simple examples
2. **Identify patterns**: Look for cycles, palindromes, or merge operations
3. **Choose technique**: Select appropriate pointer strategy
4. **Handle edges**: Consider empty lists and single nodes
5. **Optimize**: Look for constant space solutions

### Common Pitfalls
- **Memory leaks**: Always delete removed nodes
- **Null pointer access**: Check for nullptr before dereferencing
- **Infinite loops**: Be careful with cycle creation/handling
- **Off-by-one errors**: Pay attention to position calculations

### Testing Strategy
- Test with empty lists
- Test with single element
- Test with two elements
- Test with cycles (where applicable)
- Test edge positions (first, last)
