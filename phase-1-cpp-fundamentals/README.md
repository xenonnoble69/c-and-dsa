# Phase 1: C++ Fundamentals - Study Guide

## Module 1: Modern C++ Basics
This module covers the fundamental concepts of C++ programming.

### Topics Covered:
1. **C++ Basics** (`01_cpp_basics.cpp`)
   - Program structure and compilation
   - Variables and data types (int, float, double, char, string, bool)
   - Input/Output operations (cin, cout)
   - Constants and literals
   - Type casting and conversion
   - Scope and lifetime of variables

2. **Operators and Expressions** (`02_operators_expressions.cpp`)
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, ++, --)
   - Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
   - Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
   - Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   - Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
   - Conditional operator (?:)
   - Operator precedence and associativity

3. **Control Flow Statements** (`03_control_flow.cpp`)
   - if, if-else, if-else if-else statements
   - switch statements
   - Loops: for, while, do-while
   - Nested loops and control structures
   - Loop control: break, continue
   - Practical examples and algorithms

4. **Functions** (`04_functions.cpp`)
   - Function declaration and definition
   - Parameter passing: by value, by reference
   - Return types and return statements
   - Function overloading
   - Recursive functions
   - Default parameters
   - Inline functions
   - Lambda functions (C++11)
   - Function pointers

5. **Arrays and Pointers** (`05_arrays_pointers.cpp`)
   - Array declaration, initialization, and manipulation
   - Pointer fundamentals and operations
   - Pointer arithmetic
   - Arrays and pointers relationship
   - Dynamic memory allocation (new/delete)
   - Multidimensional arrays
   - String arrays and character pointers
   - Smart pointers (C++11)

### Learning Objectives:
- Master basic C++ syntax and programming constructs
- Understand memory management and pointer usage
- Write efficient functions and use appropriate control structures
- Apply operator precedence and type conversion concepts
- Handle input/output and basic file operations

### Practice Recommendations:
1. Complete all exercise problems at the end of each file
2. Build small programs combining multiple concepts
3. Practice debugging and error handling
4. Experiment with different data types and operations

## Module 2: OOP Paradigms
Object-oriented programming concepts and implementation.

### Topics Covered:
1. **Classes and Objects** (`01_classes_objects.cpp`)
   - Class definition and object creation
   - Member variables and methods
   - Access specifiers (private, protected, public)
   - Constructors and destructors
   - Static members and methods
   - Friend functions and classes
   - Copy constructor and assignment operator

### Coming Next:
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Virtual functions and abstract classes
- Operator overloading
- Templates and generic programming

## Module 3: STL Mastery
Standard Template Library usage and advanced C++ features.

### Coming Soon:
- Containers (vector, list, map, set, etc.)
- Iterators and algorithms
- Function objects and lambdas
- Move semantics and perfect forwarding
- Exception handling

## How to Use This Course:

### Step 1: Read the Theory
Each file begins with comprehensive theory sections explaining the concepts.

### Step 2: Study the Examples
Follow along with the detailed examples that demonstrate each concept.

### Step 3: Practice
Complete the practice exercises provided at the end of each file.

### Step 4: Build Projects
Apply your knowledge by building small projects that combine multiple concepts.

### Compilation Instructions:
```bash
# To compile any C++ file:
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output_name

# For debugging:
g++ -std=c++17 -g filename.cpp -o output_name

# With warnings:
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra filename.cpp -o output_name
```

### Recommended IDE Setup:
- **VS Code** with C++ extensions
- **Code::Blocks** for beginners
- **CLion** for advanced development
- **Dev-C++** for simple compilation
